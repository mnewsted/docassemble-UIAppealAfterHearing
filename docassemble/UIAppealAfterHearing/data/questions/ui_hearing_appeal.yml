  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **${ ilao_easy_form_title }** Easy Form.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [being denied unemployment insurance](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32541).

question: |
  About unemployment insurance appeals
subquestion: |
  If you are denied unemployment benefits, you have 3 opportunities to appeal:

  1. File an appeal (a Request for Reconsideration) to be heard by an IDES referee. **This program makes a Request for Reconsideration.**
  
  2. After your hearing, if you don't agree with the referee's decision, file an appeal with the Board of Review. Use a different [**Easy Form to appeal to the Board of Review**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/30846).
  
  3. Finally, if you don't agree with the Board of Review's decision, file an Administrative Review Action in Circuit Court.

  **Note:** IDES offers free legal service to represent claimants in their unemployment benefits appeals. See the [**IDES Legal Services Program**](https://ides.illinois.gov/resources/legal-services-program/legal-services.html) to find out if you qualify.

  Warning: Late request
subquestion: |
  You have 30 days from the date on the decision to send in your request. Based on the date of the decision (${ decision_date.format("MM/dd/yyyy") }), your appeal is late.

  You can still request reconsideration, but it might not be accepted. You may want to talk with a lawyer about your options. Use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help) to find free or low-cost legal services in your area.

  For example, you could say: "The decision letter I received says I was fired for misconduct. However, my employer refused to give me proper safety equipment. My job involves working with hazardous materials. When I told my boss I would not handle the waste without safety equipment, I was fired."

id: appeal reason
question: |
  Why are you appealing the ${ decision_date.format("MMMM d, YYYY") } decision?
subquestion: |
  Explain why you think the claims adjudicator's decision was wrong. You might want to focus on different things whether you left your job voluntarily (you quit) or involuntarily (you were fired or laid off). You and the employer might have different understandings about what happened. That is why it is important to explain things from your perspective.

  If you **quit**, to receive unemployment benefits you must show that you left for a good reason. It can be helpful to show what you did to try to fix problems before you quit. See ILAO's article about [getting unemployment benefits if you quit your job](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32111).

  If you were **fired**, your employer has to show that you were fired for misconduct. If you did not do what the employer said you did, you can explain that. Or you can explain how what you did was not misconduct. To learn more, see ILAO's article about [getting unemployment benefits if you were fired](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32491).
