  About unemployment insurance appeals
subquestion: |
  If you are denied unemployment benefits, you have 3 opportunities to appeal:

  1. File an appeal, (**a Request for Reconsideration**)[https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/unemployment-benefits-request-hearing] to be heard by an IDES referee.
  
  2. After your hearing, if you don't agree with the referee's decision, file an appeal with the Board of Review. **This program creates a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Review.**
  
  3. Finally, if you don't agree with the Board of Review's decision, file an Administrative Review Action in Circuit Court.

  **Note:** IDES offers free legal service to represent claimants in their unemployment benefits appeals. See the [**IDES Legal Services Program**](https://ides.illinois.gov/resources/legal-services-program/legal-services.html) to find out if you qualify.

################# Your Appeal #######################
id: termination type
question: |
  How did your employment end?
subquestion: |
  Your decision letter tells you the decision of the referee who held your hearing and heard the testimony.

  You need to explain the reason why you believe the referee's decision was wrong.

  Referees make their decisions based on how your employment ended. Your employment could have ended:

  * Voluntarily, for example you quit your job, or
  * Involuntarily, for example you were fired or the business closed.
fields:
  - How did your employment end?: termination_type
    choices: 
      - I quit.: quit
      - I was fired.: fired
---
id: quit intro
question: |
  Must have quit for good cause
subquestion: |
  To get benefits, you must prove that you quit for a good cause.

  A referee may decide you quit for a good cause and thus allow you to receive benefits if you can show one of these reasons applies to your situation.

  * The job posed a risk to your health, safety, or morals.
  * You were not able to perform your work.
  * You left because of your medical problem or the medical problem of a spouse, child, or parent. You gave your employer a doctor's note proving the illness or disability, and you told your employer you were going to miss work.
  * Your employer was violating laws regarding your wages or work conditions.
  * Your employer greatly reduced your pay, your hours, and/or your benefits.
  * You left your job because you had a serious job offer (including a starting date and rate of pay), and you stayed at your current job until just before the new job was to start.
  * For some other reason, your workplace or working conditions were such that any reasonable worker would want to quit. These reasons should be related to your ability to do your job, not what is happening in your life outside of your job.
continue button field: quit_intro  
---
id: quit solve problems
question: |
  Explain how you tried to solve problems
subquestion: |
  You also need to show that before you quit, you tried to solve the problems you were having at your job.

  For example, you could explain:
    * If you sent in a formal complaint about working conditions, or
    * If you went to talk about your work problems with your supervisor and tried to work out a solution.
    * If you did not do this, you need to explain why.

template: not_misconduct_help 	
subject: |
  **How do I know if what I did was misconduct?**	
content: |
  These will probably not be found to be misconduct.

    * You were fired because your employer thought your work wasn't good enough, but you had tried your best to do it right. For example, if you made several mistakes while operating the cash register, but did not mean to make those mistakes.
    * You didn't know what you were doing was wrong because no one had told you or warned you about it. For example, if you were not warned by your supervisor that you should lock the tool cabinet, and you didn't know it was a rule.
    * You refused to do a dangerous job after you told your employer about the danger. For example, if your employer wanted you to work on a machine without safety glasses and you refused to do it because you thought it was too dangerous.
    * You were fired for reasons that were not related to how you do your job. One example is if your employer fired you because you were stopped for a traffic violation and driving is not part of your job.
    * You were absent or late but had a good reason and notified your employer. Be prepared to prove the reason for your last absence or lateness. If you think your employer will claim that you did not call in, you should order the phone records and bring them to the hearing.
    * Your employer asked you to do something illegal or immoral, and you refused.
    * Your employment ended because the business where you worked closed.
---
id: fired intro
question: |
  Why were you fired?
subquestion: |
  Your employer has to prove that you were fired for ""misconduct."" This means that you were fired because of something you did on purpose that broke a rule or policy.

  To get benefits, you need to show that:
    * You did not do the acts which your employer says you did, or
    * Those acts were not misconduct.

  ${ collapse_template(not_misconduct_help) }

template: request_example_help	
subject: |
  **Can I see an example?**	
content: |
  For example, you could say: "The decision letter I received says I was fired for misconduct. However, my employer refused to give me proper safety equipment. My job involves working with hazardous materials. When I told my boss I would not handle the waste without safety equipment, I was fired."

id: appeal reason
question: |
  Why are you appealing the ${ decision_date.format("MMMM d, YYYY") } decision?
subquestion: |
  Explain why you think the claims adjudicator's decision was wrong. You might want to focus on different things whether you left your job voluntarily (you quit) or involuntarily (you were fired or laid off). You and the employer might have different understandings about what happened. That is why it is important to explain things from your perspective.

  If you **quit**, to receive unemployment benefits you must show that you left for a good reason. It can be helpful to show what you did to try to fix problems before you quit. See ILAO's article about [getting unemployment benefits if you quit your job](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32111).

  If you were **fired**, your employer has to show that you were fired for misconduct. If you did not do what the employer said you did, you can explain that. Or you can explain how what you did was not misconduct. To learn more, see ILAO's article about [getting unemployment benefits if you were fired](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32491).

question: |
  Additional documents
subquestion: |
  You can include other documents with your appeal to help prove your claim.

  **Note:** If you did not present these at your first hearing, you will have to explain to the Board of Review why you did not.

  You need to send a copy of these documents to the Board of Review and to your former employer.

  Some things that may be helpful depending on your situation are:

    * Your medical records,
    * A letter from your doctor or another healthcare professional,
    * Phone records, in cases where the employer claims you were absent without calling in, or
    * Any other document you think supports your version of events (or your story).

question: |
  Do you want to include a request for the transcript in your letter?
subquestion: |
  You can request a transcript of the referee hearing and a copy of the record from IDES. You can use these if you want to make an additional written argument to the Board of Review that explains why you should get benefits.

  **Important:** There is a very short deadline - 10 days from when the transcript is mailed to you - to submit your written argument to the Board of Review and to the employer.

  Like the Notice of Appeal made by this program, you can deliver your written argument to the IDES Chicago office:

    * In person,
    * Send by mail, or
    * Fax to: (630) 645-3731.

  The address of the IDES Board of Review Chicago office is on the cover letter.
